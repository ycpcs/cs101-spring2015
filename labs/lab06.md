title: "Lab 6: Checking the Weather"

Getting Started
===============

Refer to [Lab 1](lab01.html) if you need a reminder about how to start **Cygwin Terminal** or **Notepad++**.

Start by downloading [CS101\_Lab06.zip](CS101_Lab06.zip), saving it in the directory **H:\\CS101**.

Start a **Cygwin Terminal** and run the following commands:

    cd h:
    cd CS101
    unzip CS101_Lab06.zip
    cd CS101_Lab06

Using **Notepad++**, open the file

> **H:\\CS101\\CS101\_Lab06\\WeatherApp.cpp**

Your Task
=========

Write a program that provides some feedback on the weather conditions given the current temperature and chance for precipitation.

Your program should prompt the user to enter the current temperature and the chance for precipitation (as a percentage). Based on the temperature, your program should then print one of the following messages:

-   If the temperature is **greater than or equal to 90 degrees**, print:  
    *"It's a scorcher!"*

-   If the temperature is **below 90 degrees, but higher than or equal to 70 degrees**, print:  
    *"It's a warm day."*

-   If the temperature is **below 70 degrees, but higher than or equal to 32 degrees**, print:  
    *"It's a cool day."*

-   If the temperature is **below 32 degrees, but higher than 0 degrees**, print:  
    *"It's very cold outside."*

-   If the temperature is **0 degrees and below**, print:  
    *"You'll freeze out there."*

**Additionally**, your program should simulate the weather to determine whether or not it rained. To do this, first generate a random number such that there are 100 possible values (e.g., 0 to 99, or 1 to 100). If the generated number is less than the percent chance of precipitation entered by the user, then your program should indicate that it has precipitated. Otherwise, your program should indicate that it has not precipitated.

Example run (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Enter the current temperature: <b>78</b>
What is the chance of precipitation (in percentage): <b>85</b>

It's a warm day.
It's raining, better bring an umbrella.
</pre>

In the example above, there was an 85 percent chance of precipitation, and it rained.

Another example (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Enter the current temperature: <b>53</b>
What is the chance of precipitation (in percentage): <b>76</b>

It's a cool day.
No rain today.
</pre>

In this second example, there was an 76 percent chance of precipitation, but it did not rain.

A third example (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Enter the current temperature: <b>25</b>
What is the chance of precipitation (in percentage): <b>88</b>

It's very cold outside.
It's snowing, put on your boots.
</pre>

In this example, there was an 88 percent chance of precipitation and because it was so cold, it snowed.

When you are ready to compile the program, in the Cygwin window type the command

    make

To run the program, in the Cygwin window type the command

    ./WeatherApp.exe

Hints
=====

Use an **if/else if** statement to determine which message to print. Use a second **if/else if** statement to determine which of the three precipitation messages to print.

It snows when precipitation occurs at temperates less than or equal to 32 degrees.

You should add the following **\#include** directives at the top of the file:

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
{% endhighlight %}

Near the beginning of the statements in your **main** function add the statement

{% highlight cpp %}
srand(time(0));
{% endhighlight %}

This statement will seed the random number generator with a value based on the current time.

When the program simulates the weather, it can "randomly" choose an integer with 100 possible values (0 to 99 inclusive) using the expression

{% highlight cpp %}
rand() % 100
{% endhighlight %}

Submit
======

To submit your work, type the command

    make submit

Enter your Marmoset username and password (which you should have received by email.) Note that your password will not be echoed to the screen.

**Important**:

> You **must** submit your work before leaving class. If you do not submit, you will not receive any credit for the lab.
